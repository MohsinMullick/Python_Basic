"""
Casting:Changing a variable data type into another type
like int to float
str to int
"""
x=int(3)#x variable and value integer type
y=str(3)#y variable declare and str data tpe value
z=float(3)#z variable declare and float data type
print(x)#python will always keep track of its current value so out put 3
print(y)# python will always keep track of its current values so output string value 3
print(z)#python will always keep track of its current value so output floating point 3.0


x=5#variable x with integer value 5
y="Mohsin"#variable y with string value Mohsin
print(type(x))#python will  always keep track of its current value so output data type class int
print(type(y))#python wil always keep track of its current value so output data type class str




x=5#  # variable x with integer value 5
y=float(x) # convert int to float (5 → 5.0)
print(y)#python will always keep track of its current value


x=3.7#variable x with floating vale 3.7
y=int(x)#convert float to int(3.7→ 3)
print(y)#python will always keep track of its current value so output integer type 3
